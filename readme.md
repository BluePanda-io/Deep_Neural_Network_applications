# Deep Neural Network applications

Two applications of Deep Neural Networks that I built during a DNN Specialization course in Coursera - Originally developed 04/05/2019

"You can find everything on the two JupyterNotebooks"

## What was developed in this project
These applications were my favorite part of the course, teaching me how to use frameworks to create real world projects using Deep Learning.
